# API-Task

Author: Benjamin Warren
Task: Creating a class which does an API call and then using some of the functionality of said code.
The classes created are designed to pull out information regarding any year that there was F1. The task is not completed without errors due to the confusing nature of the extra methods to dicts conversion step resulting in me runnning out of time.
